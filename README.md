## VanillaJS 30 days challenge!

All challenges come from this Wesbos's course/challenge [30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/), which is quite a mouthful but it's also a **FREE COURSE**. Since free stuff is usually a good thing, and Javascript usage gets more tracking by the day... join the fray, make the pledge, hone your VanillaJS skills, learn new shit.
